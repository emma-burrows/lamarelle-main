   <h1>The Charity</h1>

<p>Founded in 2009, La Marelle (&quot;hopscotch&quot; in French) is a charity registered with 
    the Charity Commission for England and Wales as number 1135186. <a  href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1135186&SubsidiaryNumber=0">View La Marelle's entry on the Charity Commission's website</a>.</p>

<p>Its main purpose is to help French-speaking families to pass on their language 
    and culture to their children thanks to a Saturday morning school, similar to
    <a href="http://www.petites-ecoles.co.uk">the ones which exist</a> in other 
    parts of the United Kingdom. The school is supported by the French Embassy&#39;s 
    &quot;Plan Ecoles&quot;, whose purpose is to encourage French lessons aimed at children 
    from a French-speaking background.</p>

<p>La Marelle also has classes for French as a foreign language, as well as an 
    informal café on Saturday mornings.</p>
