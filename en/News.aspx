<tm:dynamicheading id="Dynamicheading01" text="First “Rentrée” for Dartford’s French school" headingstyle="Cursif" runat="server" />

<p>La Marelle, Dartford’s new Saturday morning school for bilingual French-speaking children, started its lessons on 25 April at Fleetdown Junior School, with over 40 pupils attending.</p> 

<p>The occasion was marked by a visit from Vincent Gleizes, attaché for the French language at the French Consulate in London, who delivered a short speech about the importance of bilingualism and the French Embassy’s support for initiatives like La Marelle.</p> 

<p>The school is a charity run by a group of French mothers and teachers who wanted to see their language and culture passed on to their children. With the support of the French Embassy's “plan école”, La Marelle aims to help children from a French-speaking background to develop their knowledge of the French language and the culture of the French-speaking world. </p> 

<p>La Marelle’s pupils, who are all enrolled in local English schools in North-West Kent during the week, are from a variety of multicultural backgrounds, not only English and French, but also with parents from Portugal, Algeria, Sri Lanka or Madagascar.</p> 

<p>The children, aged 3 to 12, enjoyed their first day at French school and the facilities offered by Fleetdown Junior School, which has offered La Marelle a warm welcome for its Saturday morning sessions.</p> 

<p>Over the next few sessions, the school will be preparing for a visit from Dr Howard Stoate, MP for Dartford, on 16 May.</p>
