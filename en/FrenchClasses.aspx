      <p>La Marelle now offers classes to English-speaking students. All sessions are taught by native French-speaking teachers.</p> 
      
      <h2>Classes for GCSE students</h2>
      <p>La Marelle provides classes to help young people prepare their French GCSE exams. 
      These lessons are currently incorporated into the second half of the French school's highest class, les 
      Libellules, where English students will be alongside native French speakers for one hour and a half. If required, 
      the exam can also be taken early in an independent examination centre.</p>


      <h2>Classes for Children</h2>
      <table cellpadding="0"><tr><td><img src="../images/frog.png" height="100px" alt="Frog"/></td>
      <td>La Marelle offers two courses for children aged 3-5 and 6-11. It is a good preparation for secondary school and gives children confidence in learning a second language.<br />
        We teach French through games, songs, stories and crafts while encouraging the children's natural desire for communication with an emphasis on fun. At this age children are ready to reproduce the sounds and accent of the foreign language, which will provide them with good sound linguistic skills.</td></tr></table>
